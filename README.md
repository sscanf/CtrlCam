I developed this project in early 2000.

It is a firmware for a device manufactured by the company to control security cameras.

From the device it is possible to control the camera up, down, right, left, zoom in, zoom out, focus, etc.

The device allows connection to a PC via RS232 to be controlled by a Windows application.
